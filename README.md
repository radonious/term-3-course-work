# Dynamic data structure using template

## Structure type
Simply words: 2D singly linked list

According to task: 
The data structure template is a singly linked list, each element of which is the head of the singly linked list.
The second-level list element contains a pointer to an object.

## Set of operations:
1) add, remove, earse by logical number
2) include and extract by logical number with preservation of order
3) forward and backward sort
4) load and save in a binary file
5) balancing (alignment of the dimensions of lower-level data structures)

## Other conditions:
It is assumed that comparison operations of stored objects redefined in a standard way (in the form of <,> operations, etc.) 
The program must use the template class with string objects and implement the above actions on text of any size loaded from a file.
